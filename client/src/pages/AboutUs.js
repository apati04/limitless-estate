              My passion is in helping others and making a difference in any way
              I can. I find gratitude in helping others find solutions and I
              strive to make a memorable impact on others. I enjoy contributing
              this aspect to whomever I can and that’s what makes it different
              from a “have to do” to a “love to do.” I have experience with
              operations management; staff development; revenue management;
              expense and budget management; food & beverage operations;
              inventory management; merchandise administration; driving sales;

            <p className="mt-1">
              <strong>Early Life: </strong>At a young age, I quickly learned the
              meaning of discipline and dedication. I picked up the game of golf
              when I was 10, was playing in competitive tournaments by the time
              I was 13, and by the time I was 17, I had traveled and competed in
              34 of 50 states.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-1">
              <strong>Education & Amateur Status: </strong>I attended UC Irvine
              on a full-ride athletic scholarship but was raised and believed to
              always put my academics first. I graduated from UC Irvine in June
              2012 with a degree in Sociology and minor in Public Health. Out of
              my 4 years’ attendance, I was a 3-time Dean’s list honoree, 3-time
              Big West Scholar-Athlete, First Team All Big West, Big West Player
              of the Month in March 2012, led the nation in NCAA D1 Par 3
              scoring average in 2009 and made UC Irvine history being selected
              for 2011 NCAA All-Star golf team. I ended my amateur career with a
              win at the 2012 Long Beach City Women’s Championship, which gave
              me the confidence boost to pursue golf at a higher level.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-1">
              <strong>Professional Career: </strong>I competed on the LPGA
              Symetra Tour, Cactus Tour and Canadian Tour. I got through my
              professional golf career by the help of sponsors and endorsements.
              Since golf is an individual sport, I worked hard to create an
              image for myself and be my own brand. I learned to represent
              myself in a way that would make sponsors interested to invest in
              me and my golf game. I was successful at raising over $300k to
              fund my own sponsorship throughout the course of 3 years. Through
              experience, I can highlight the fact that the importance of a
              company’s sponsorship success is defined by the end result and
              being beneficial to both parties. In 2005, I appeared and competed
              on a reality TV show, Golf Channel’s Altered Course Montego Bay.

              <strong>Golf Industry: </strong>For the past 2 years, I have
              worked for Strato Partners as a Regional Sales Director and
              Assistant General Manager. Within this job, I have made myself
              familiar and competent with defining what is important in managing
              a $4 million+ business. Strato Partners make it a #1 priority to
              have each and every guest leave with a great customer experience.

              <strong>Other: </strong>I constantly set goals for myself,
              mentally and physically, and I persistently try to achieve them. I
              am continually learning to grow and improve as a person by pushing
              limits. I plan to work my way out of the golf industry and
              completely out of my comfort zone. I have found real estate to be
              my new quest and chase in life. I am driven and relentless, and
              these skills make me a valuable asset to my team. My goals for the
              future would be to become an all-around real estate expert,
              continually grow my portfolio and to be an entrepreneur duo with
              my fiancé. For me, it would be so special to be able to look back
              one day to see how far we’ve come and share the successes
              together.
