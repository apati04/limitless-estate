                family, nothing is more important than family. I am a big

            <p>
              My passion is in helping others and making a difference in any way
              I can. I find gratitude in helping others find solutions and I
              strive to make a memorable impact on others. I enjoy contributing
              this aspect to whomever I can and that’s what makes it different
              from a “have to do” to a “love to do.” I have experience with
              operations management; staff development; revenue management;
              expense and budget management; food & beverage operations;
              inventory management; merchandise administration; driving sales;
              leverage pricing; marketing; and social media marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early Life: At a young age, I quickly learned the meaning of
              discipline and dedication. I picked up the game of golf when I was
              10, was playing in competitive tournaments by the time I was 13,
              and by the time I was 17, I had traveled and competed in 34 of 50
              states.
            </p>
            <p>
              Education & Amateur Status: I attended UC Irvine on a full-ride
              athletic scholarship but was raised and believed to always put my
              academics first. I graduated from UC Irvine in June 2012 with a
              degree in Sociology and minor in Public Health. Out of my 4 years’
              attendance, I was a 3-time Dean’s list honoree, 3-time Big West
              Scholar-Athlete, First Team All Big West, Big West Player of the
              Month in March 2012, led the nation in NCAA D1 Par 3 scoring
              average in 2009 and made UC Irvine history being selected for 2011
              NCAA All-Star golf team. I ended my amateur career with a win at
              the 2012 Long Beach City Women’s Championship, which gave me the
              confidence boost to pursue golf at a higher level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Professional Career: I competed on the LPGA Symetra Tour, Cactus
              Tour and Canadian Tour. I got through my professional golf career
              by the help of sponsors and endorsements. Since golf is an
              individual sport, I worked hard to create an image for myself and
              be my own brand. I learned to represent myself in a way that would
              make sponsors interested to invest in me and my golf game. I was
              successful at raising over $300k to fund my own sponsorship
              throughout the course of 3 years. Through experience, I can
              highlight the fact that the importance of a company’s sponsorship
              success is defined by the end result and being beneficial to both
              parties. In 2005, I appeared and competed on a reality TV show,
              Golf Channel’s Altered Course Montego Bay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Golf Industry: For the past 2 years, I have worked for Strato
              Partners as a Regional Sales Director and Assistant General
              Manager. Within this job, I have made myself familiar and
              competent with defining what is important in managing a $4
              million+ business. Strato Partners make it a #1 priority to have
              each and every guest leave with a great customer experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other: I constantly set goals for myself, mentally and physically,
              and I persistently try to achieve them. I am continually learning
              to grow and improve as a person by pushing limits. I plan to work
              my way out of the golf industry and completely out of my comfort
              zone. I have found real estate to be my new quest and chase in
              life. I am driven and relentless, and these skills make me a
              valuable asset to my team. My goals for the future would be to
              become an all-around real estate expert, continually grow my
              portfolio and to be an entrepreneur duo with my fiancé. For me, it
              would be so special to be able to look back one day to see how far
              we’ve come and share the successes together.
