                  <strong>Other: </strong> I played golf Professionally for a
                  few years around California before working full-time for
                  American Golf. I am a dog owner & lover, I enjoy cooking,
                  traveling, fitness & sports. I currently live in Southern
                  California and the thing I am most looking forward to this
                  year is planning my wedding with my fiancé. The most important
                  thing I have learned over the last 12 months is how important
                  it is to spend time and care for your family, nothing is more
                  important than family. I am a big believer in a positive
                  mindset, continued education, improving yourself day by day
                  and taking massive action.
